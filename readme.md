# TaskBarTools

If you're like me and end up with tons of command prompt windows, browsers, et cetera, open all at once, this tool allows me to close all instances, or to force quit if I need to. It also allows me to quickly take a screen snip and copies it to the clipboard. 

## Features

- **Quit All Instances**: Easily close all running instances of an application with a simple right-click option in the system tray menu.

- **Force Quit Individual Instances**: If an application is not responding, you can forcefully terminate it without affecting other instances of the same application.

- **Screenshot Tool**: A handy feature that allows you to select and capture any part of your screen, making it easy to share or save information quickly.

## Usage

Once you run TaskBarTools, it will appear in your system tray (also known as the notification area). By right-clicking on the TaskBarTools icon, you will see a list of applications that currently have taskbar buttons.

### Quitting Applications

- **Quit All**: Hover over an application to see this option. Clicking "Quit All" will send an exit command to all instances of that application.
  
- **Force Quit**: If you need to forcefully close a frozen or unresponsive application, expand the application's menu, hover over the specific instance, and select "Force Quit". You'll receive a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental termination.

### Taking Screenshots

- **Snipping Tool**: At the bottom of the main context menu, you'll find an option to "Snip & Copy". Selecting this will change your cursor to a crosshair, allowing you to click and drag to select a region of the screen. Once you release the mouse button, the selected region will be captured and copied to your clipboard, ready for pasting into your favorite image editor or document.
